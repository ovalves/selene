     *
     * - If the Host header is missing or empty, and the new URI contains
     *   a host component, this method MUST update the Host header in the returned
     *   request.
     * - If the Host header is missing or empty, and the new URI does not contain a
     *   host component, this method MUST NOT update the Host header in the returned
     *   request.
     * - If a Host header is present and non-empty, this method MUST NOT update
     *   the Host header in the returned request.
     *
     * This method MUST be implemented in such a way as to retain the
     * immutability of the message, and MUST return an instance that has the
     * new UriInterface instance.
